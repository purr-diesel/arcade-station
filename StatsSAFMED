Mean is a method to describe the center of a data set. 

Xbar is a symbol for the sample mean.

Mu is a symbol for the population mean.

The sample mean, Xbar, can be used as a point estimate of the population mean, Mu-X. The point estimates of larger samples tend to be more accurate than those base on smaller samples (pg. 29).
